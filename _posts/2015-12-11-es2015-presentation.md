You can find the slides for a presentation that I gave on ES2015 and ES2016+ [here](https://d3spis3d.github.io/es2015-deep-dive-pres). In the presentation I cover new features added to JavaScript as part of the ES2015 specification, and features that will be added in future versions of the ECMAScript specification.

I created the presentation using the wonderful [Bespoke.js](https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke) framework. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in creating presentations using JS, HTML and CSS.
